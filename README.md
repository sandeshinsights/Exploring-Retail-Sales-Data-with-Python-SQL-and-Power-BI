# Exploring Retail Sales Data with Python, SQL, and Power BI

## Business Problem / Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a retail company to understand business performance and customer behavior. The dataset contains information about transactions, including branch locations, product categories, payment methods, sales amounts, customer ratings, and profit margins.

The goal is to answer key business questions that help improve sales, increase customer satisfaction, and optimize operations. By analyzing this data, we provide useful insights for decision-makers to plan better marketing strategies, improve product offerings, and grow the business.
